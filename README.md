### Tools for time-limited, team-based, open-by-default collaboration

`dribdat` is an open source web application that assists teams working playfully on projects with data. Originally designed to promote and support [data expeditions](https://schoolofdata-ch.github.io/index.en.html) and [awesome hackathons](https://github.com/dribdat/awesome-hackathon), it is akin to a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Swiss Army Knife for event organizers: a website, guidelines, countdown clock, challenge board, project log, progress tracker, integrations with popular chat platforms, code repositories, and open data APIs.

The philosophy of this project, in a nutshell, is: **live and let live** (no tech religion, use whatever design / dev / doc tools you want as long as they are accessible to your team), **commit sustainably** (aggregate outputs in standard web of data formats for optimal search and archiving), **create in safe spaces** (embedded code of conduct, works offline, minimal privacy footprint).

_If you use dribdat for your event, please add yourself to the [Tour de Hack](https://meta.dribdat.cc/event/5)! It only takes a minute, and knowing that dribdat is helping real events helps keep the ðŸ”¥ alive._

# Quickstart

This project can be deployed to any server capable of serving Python applications, and is set up for fast deployment using [Ansible or Docker](https://dribdat.cc/deploy). The first user that registers becomes an admin, so don't delay! 

If you would like to run dribdat on any other cloud or local machine, there are additional instructions in the [Deployment guide](https://docs.dribdat.cc/deploy/). Information on contributing and extending dribdat can be found in the [Contributors guide](https://docs.dribdat.cc/contribute/), which includes API documentation, and other details.

See also **[backboard](https://github.com/dribdat/backboard)**, a sample responsive web application, and our **[dridbot](https://github.com/dribdat/dridbot)** chat client, which both demonstrate reuse of the dribdat API.

If you need support with your deployment, please reach out through [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/dribdat/discussions).

Special thanks to the [Open Data](https://opendata.ch), [Open Networking](https://opennetworkinfrastructure.org/) and [Open Source](https://dinacon.ch) communities in Switzerland for the many trials and feedbacks through over one hundred events.

This project is inspired by the work of many wonderful hackathonistas to the [East](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/42), [West](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/7), [North](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/10), and [South](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/41) of here. We are grateful to F. Wieser and M.-C. Gasser at [Swisscom](http://swisscom.com) for conceptual inputs and financial support at an early stage of this project. This application was based on Steven Loria's [cookiecutter-flask](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask), a more modern version of which is [cookiecutter-flask-restful](https://github.com/karec/cookiecutter-flask-restful), and could be a good basis for your own hackathon projects. 

Additional and â™¥-felt thanks for your contributions to: [Alexandre Cotting](https://github.com/Cotting), [Anthony Ritz](https://github.com/RitzAnthony), [Chris Mutel](https://github.com/cmutel), [Fabien Schwob](https://github.com/jibaku), [Gonzalo Casas](https://github.com/gonzalocasas), [Jonathan Schnyder](https://github.com/jonHESSO), [Jonathan Sobel](https://github.com/JonathanSOBEL), [Philip Shemella](https://github.com/philshem), [Thomas Amberg](https://github.com/tamberg), [Yusuf Khasbulatov](https://github.com/khashashin) .. and all the participants and organizers sending in bugs and requests!
